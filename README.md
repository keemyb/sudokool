sudokool
========

This is a multipurpose sudoku utility. With it you can generate, play and solve puzzles.

While a fast way to solve puzzles has been implemented, sudokool uses human methods to solve puzzles, which means it is a great tool to help you understand exactly why a value fits in a certain location.

Currently sudoku sizes ranging from 4 to 25 are supported, but puzzles greater than the standard size 9 may take a while to generate.

A basic GUI requiring the kivy framework is used.
